                    <storng>Heya Muski!!!</storng> Wish you a very very Happy Birthday...from basketball ground(where we 1st met, but u won't agree) to this lockdown which is just 2 yrs it seems like we have travelled so far in so less time and that too without actually travelling that i feel like <i><b>Hey karmsathi, god has got us together and so i'll always have u beside me in all my karma(deeds)be it normal or abnormal bcuz college life without u is ummmm...imaginable but not worth living </b></i>and so for that and for all you desire, may god bless you with strength, may happiness follows its way to u and since u have got quite a todo list may you be an efficient time-manager and accomplish all of your tasks. Last but not the least Toast to miss Fixit, the one who is selfless, caring and befriends everyone and...And to the one who uses +1, legit, stickers wherever <u>not required</u>.Once again many many happy returns of the DAY!
